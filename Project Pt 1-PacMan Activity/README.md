# Project Pt 1 - PacMan Activity
For your first project, you'll be working on part 1 of the PacMan exercise. Your task is to simulate the PacMan moving across the screen and reversing direction when it reaches the edge of the page. Through this exercise, you'll learn how to control the DOM. The DOM holds data such as HTML objects or elements of a webpage. Don't worry if you aren't familiar with the concept of DOM. You'll learn about working with the DOM later in the course.
